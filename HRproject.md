# HR Survey Analysis

This project is based on the findings of attrition ratios divided on three indetified fields. 

This dashboard helps to uderstand the attrition ratio based on: 
        1. Attrition by demographics. 
        2. Attrition by Turnover Analysis
        3. Employee Wellness.

Demogrpahic ratio is discussed based on the Martial Status, Distance from home, age group, gender, education field as well as work life balance check. On the other hand turnover analysis discusses about the reason of churn rate among employees be it male or female. Lastly, we discussed about attrition based on projecting the employee Wellness survey data. Overall, this can be a best fit in discussing not only the 3 major fields discussed above but also helps in understanding the diversity and inclusion based on the employees prefrences and their Wellness.
